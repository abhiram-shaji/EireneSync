The `TodoScreen` component is a part of a React Native application that integrates with Firebase Firestore for task management. Here's an overview of its functionality and structure:

### Imports and Dependencies
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) for state management and lifecycle events.
- React Navigation's `useFocusEffect` hook is used to handle the back button behavior on Android devices.
- Firebase Firestore and Authentication services are utilized to manage tasks and user authentication.
- `NavbarTop` and `NavbarBottom` are custom components for the application's navigation.

### Component Functionality
- The component maintains local state for task input (`task`) and an array of tasks (`tasks`).
- It establishes a connection to Firestore and accesses the current user via Firebase Authentication.
- Defines a Firestore collection reference (`userTasksCollection`) to interact with the `tasks` collection in Firestore.

### Lifecycle and Effects
- `useFocusEffect` is used to override the default Android back button behavior, exiting the app if the current screen is focused.
- `useEffect` loads tasks from Firestore whenever the component mounts or the authenticated user changes, querying tasks where the `userId` matches the current user's ID.

### Task Management
- `addTask` function allows adding new tasks to Firestore and the local state, ensuring the task input is not empty before proceeding.
- `deleteTask` function removes a task from both Firestore and the local state using the task's key.

### UI Components
- A text input allows users to enter new tasks.
- An `Add Task` button triggers the `addTask` function.
- A `FlatList` displays the tasks, with each item having a `Delete` button to remove the task.

### Return Structure
- Renders a view containing `NavbarTop`, the main content area for task management, and `NavbarBottom`.
- The main content area includes the text input for adding tasks, the add task button, and the list of tasks with delete functionality.

### Integration and Navigation
- The `TodoScreen` integrates with the broader application through the `navigation` prop, allowing navigation between screens.
- `NavbarBottom` is passed the `navigation` object, likely for navigation purposes within the lower navbar.

This component serves as a functional part of the application, allowing users to manage tasks dynamically, with changes reflected in real-time both locally and in the Firestore database.
