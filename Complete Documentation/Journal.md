The `JournalScreen` component in a React Native application serves as a digital journal, allowing users to create and view journal entries. It uses Firebase Firestore for data storage and retrieval.

### Component Overview
- **State Management**:
  - `entry`: A string state holding the current journal entry text that the user is typing.
  - `entries`: An array state containing all journal entries fetched from Firestore.
- **Firestore Integration**:
  - Initializes Firestore and defines the `entriesCollection` to interact with the `journalEntries` collection in Firestore.

### Effects and Data Loading
- `useEffect`: On component mount, it loads journal entries from Firestore, mapping through the documents to set the `entries` state.

### Journal Entry Management
- **Adding an Entry**:
  - `addEntry`: A function to add a new journal entry to Firestore. It checks if the entry text is not empty, creates a new entry object with the current date, and updates Firestore and local state.
- **UI Components**:
  - A `TextInput` for writing new journal entries, supporting multiline input.
  - An `Add Entry` button to submit the current entry to Firestore and clear the input field.
  - A `FlatList` displaying all journal entries, each showing the date and text of the entry.

### Layout and Styling
- Uses `styles` from `../styles` for consistent styling across the application.
- `NavbarTop` and `NavbarBottom` components are included for consistent navigation and UI layout.

### Render Method
- The screen layout comprises a top navigation bar (`NavbarTop`), the main content area for journal entry input and display, and a bottom navigation bar (`NavbarBottom`).
- The main content area has a text input field for entering journal entries and a list (`FlatList`) displaying existing entries, with each entry showing its date and text.

### Functionality and User Interaction
- Users can write their thoughts or events in the text input field and add them to their journal via the `Add Entry` button.
- Entries are displayed in reverse chronological order (assuming the newest entries are shown first based on how they are added to the state).
- The journal entries are persisted in Firestore, making them accessible across sessions and devices.

This component integrates with the rest of the application through its use of shared styles and navigation elements, ensuring a consistent user experience and seamless functionality within the app's overall flow.
