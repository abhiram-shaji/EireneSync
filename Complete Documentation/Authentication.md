### `SignUpScreen.js`

This component allows users to create a new account.

- **State Management**:
  - Uses `useState` to manage email, password, and confirmPassword inputs.
- **Functionality**:
  - `handleSignUp` is the main function that triggers the sign-up process.
  - Checks if the password and confirmPassword match; if not, it shows an alert and stops the process.
  - Utilizes `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` from Firebase to create a new user account.
  - On successful account creation, navigates to the `TodoScreen`.
  - Handles errors related to email usage and validity.
- **UI Components**:
  - Text inputs for email, password, and confirmPassword.
  - A sign-up button that triggers the `handleSignUp` function.
- **Styling**:
  - Uses a `styles` object imported from `../styles` for consistent styling across the app.

### `LoginScreen.js`

This component facilitates user login.

- **State Management**:
  - Manages email and password inputs using `useState`.
- **Functionality**:
  - `handleLogin` attempts to log in the user with `signInWithEmailAndPassword` from Firebase.
  - On successful login, navigates to the `TodoScreen`.
  - Provides error handling for cases like user not found and incorrect password.
  - `handleSignUp` simply navigates to the `SignUpScreen` for new users.
- **UI Components**:
  - Text inputs for email and password.
  - Login and SignUp buttons to trigger respective functions.
- **Styling**:
  - Uses the same `styles` object for consistent appearance with the `SignUpScreen`.

### Integration and Flow

- Both screens are part of the user authentication journey in the application.
- `SignUpScreen` is for new users to create an account, while `LoginScreen` is for existing users to access their accounts.
- They interact with Firebase Authentication for secure user management and navigate to the `TodoScreen` upon successful authentication, integrating them into the broader app navigation managed in `Navigation.js`.

The `App.js` and `firebaseConfig.js` files are foundational to the React Native application, integrating the navigation structure and Firebase services, respectively.

### `App.js`

This is the entry point of the React Native application.

- **Imports and Components**:
  - Imports the `Navigation` component from `./Navigation`.
  - Defines the `App` functional component, which simply returns the `Navigation` component. This sets up the navigation flow for the entire application, as defined in the `Navigation.js` file.

### `firebaseConfig.js`

This file configures and initializes Firebase services for the app.

- **Firebase Initialization**:
  - Imports necessary Firebase modules, including `initializeApp` for Firebase setup and `initializeAuth`, `getReactNativePersistence` for authentication.
  - Defines `firebaseConfig`, which contains the Firebase project's configuration details like API key, project ID, etc.
  - Calls `initializeApp` with `firebaseConfig` to initialize the Firebase app instance.
- **Firebase Authentication**:
  - Initializes Firebase Authentication using `initializeAuth`, specifying `getReactNativePersistence` with `ReactNativeAsyncStorage` to handle auth session persistence in React Native's storage mechanism.
- **Exports**:
  - The `app` (Firebase app instance) and `auth` (Firebase Auth instance) are exported for use throughout the application, allowing other components (like `SignUpScreen` and `LoginScreen`) to access Firebase services.

### Integration

- `App.js` acts as the root component, wrapping the navigation structure of the application, which includes the authentication flow and navigation between different screens.
- `firebaseConfig.js` sets up the Firebase environment, ensuring that Firebase services, especially authentication, are initialized and available for use across the application, including in the navigation and authentication logic implemented in `Navigation.js`, `SignUpScreen.js`, and `LoginScreen.js`.
- This setup ensures a cohesive structure where Firebase services support the authentication needs of the app, and the navigation flow is centrally managed and integrated with these services.
